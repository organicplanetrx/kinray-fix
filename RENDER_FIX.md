# Render Deployment Fix - Package Manager Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
Render was detecting yarn and attempting to run `yarn start` in the wrong directory:
```
error Couldn't find a package.json file in "/opt/render/project/src"
```

## Solution Applied
Updated `render.yaml` configuration to use direct commands instead of package manager scripts:

### Before (Causing Issues)
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
startCommand: npm run start  # This was triggering yarn detection
```

### After (Fixed)
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build  # Fixed npm ci issue
startCommand: node dist/index.js  # Direct node command, bypasses package manager
```

## Additional Changes Made
1. **Removed yarn.lock** - Prevents yarn auto-detection
2. **Updated .npmrc** - Added engine-strict for consistency
3. **Direct start command** - Uses `node dist/index.js` instead of package scripts

## Expected Deployment Result
- Build will use npm (not yarn)
- Start command bypasses package manager detection
- Server starts directly from built files in `dist/index.js`
- Connection test fixes will be deployed successfully

## Next Steps
1. Push the updated render.yaml to Git
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Test connection functionality immediately after deployment

The connection test timeout fixes are ready - this package manager issue was the only deployment blocker.
